        <p> Down the street you can hear her scream "you're a disgrace"</p>
        <p> As she slams the door in his drunken face,</p>
        <p> And now he stands outside</p>
        <p> And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool</p>
        <p> He cries "Oh girl, you must be mad,</p>
        <p> What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"</p>
        <p> Against the door he leans and starts a scene,</p>
        <p>  And his tears fall and burn the garden green</p>
        <p> And so castles made of sand,</p>
        <p> Fall in the sea, eventually</p>
        <p> A little Indian brave who before he was ten,</p>
        <p> Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends,</p>
        <p> And he built a dream that when he grew up,</p>
        <p> He would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief</p>
        <p> Many moons passed and more the dream grew stronger,</p>
        <p> Until tomorrow, he would sing his first war song,</p>
        <p> And fight his first battle, but something went wrong,</p>
        <p> Surpriseâ€¦</p>
